  m_overrideMarkdownText: "\n\n*North Star* is a visual showcase that demonstrates
    the visual fidelity possible on Meta Quest devices. It has been built using <a
    href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-interaction-sdk-overview/\">*Interaction
    SDK*</a>\_for interactions, <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/move-overview\">*Movement
    SDK*</a> for full body tracking, and <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/meta-xr-audio-sdk-unity\">*Audio
    SDK*</a> for spatialized sounds. It is designed to be used primarily for the
    best intended hand-tracking experience but also provides full controller support.\n\nInspired
    by the age of sail and exploration, you play as a new deckhand aboard the _Polaris_,
    a ship with a dedicated crew on a quest to find a mythical sunken treasure at
    Ocean Deep.\n\nYou can play this showcase for free on the <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/north-star/28679538058299918/\">Horizon
    Store</a>.\n\n\n# Showcase Features\n\nEach of these features have been built
    to be accessible and scalable for other developers to take and build upon in
    their own projects.\n\n\n## Ocean\n\n*North Star* includes a highly customizable
    ocean system that is optimized to be quite performant on device while achieving
    a visually realistic ocean volume. Developers can control the hue, activity/choppiness
    of the water, reflections, height and intensity of waves through the inspector,
    and transition smoothly between profiles.\n\n\n## Boat Movement\n\nMost of the
    game takes place *Polaris* as it sails through a variety of ocean conditions,
    *North Star* achieves a variable motion on the boat to simulate the natural bobbing
    and swaying of sailing while paying special heed to the player\u2019s comfort.\n\n\n##
    Comfort Settings\n\nBefore starting the game, players can set up their experience
    through the main menu. In addition to seated mode and height detection, they
    can elect their sailing comfort level. There are 4 comfort levels to choose from
    (Calm, Choppy, Rough, Sailor), with the lowest dampening the natural movement
    of the boat to be negligible, and each following level intensifying the sailing
    experience further toward the highest and most realistic level.\n\n\n## Time
    of Day\n\nIncluded in the *North Star* project is a Time of Day system, where
    designers can define Environment Profiles to determine the sun/moon position,
    color of the sky, directional light, and more. Designers can set up multiple
    Environment Profiles and either transition between them over a duration, or switch
    to new profiles immediately (ie: during a teleport or load screen).\n\n\n## Ropes\n\n*North
    Star* was built with the intention of providing the most realistic and tactile
    rope interactions available in VR gaming. Ropes respond naturally when interacted
    with, allowing players to wrap them around other objects (like securing the rope
    from the mainsail to a cleat), swing and propel other objects (like a life buoy)
    and generally behave realistically when thrown, pulled and jiggled.\n\n\n## Interactables\n\nUtilizing
    Meta\u2019s Interactions SDK and built specifically with hand tracking in mind,
    there are a variety of unique interactions available within the *North Star*
    experience:\n\n**Rope & sail manipulation**: Pull ropes to raise the mainsail
    and secure it off on a cleat, untie to furl the sails.\n\n**Cranks**: Use a crank
    to re-angle the sails to line them up with windsocks and catch the breeze!\n\n**Levers**:
    Pull the lever to begin the descent of the Diving Bell.\n\n**Harpoon Gun**: Load
    bolts, pull back the tension, aim and hit the button to let loose a harpoon!
    Wind the cranks to retrieve cargo salvaged from the ocean.\n\n**Spyglass**: Extend
    the spyglass and hold it to an eye to magnify your view and look through fog.\n\n**Object
    Manipulation**: Pick up and interact naturally with a number of objects found
    aboard the *Polaris*, and take your turn navigating at the helm!\n\n\n## Narrative
    & NPCs\n\nEngage in an exciting adventure inspired by the age of exploration!
    Join the dynamic crew of the *Polaris* as it sets sail to find a mythical and
    mysterious treasure in the depths of the ocean known as Ocean Deep. Fully animated
    and voiced NPCs guide you through your adventure, utilizing lipsync technology
    when addressing you, the new deckhand.\n\n\n## Free Sailing\n\nJump into free
    sailing mode to put everything you\u2019ve learned along your journey to the
    test! Freely manipulate the sails to catch the wind and feel the ocean rock you
    under your feet.\n\n\n# Source Voiceovers\n\nTo protect the voiceover talent
    employed for this project, the original source VO files that are utilized in
    the store release of North Star are not present in this public project repository.
    Instead all original source VO files have been replaced with rudimentary placeholder
    generated VO.\n\nAll original VO talent was sourced from the <a href=\"https://bigmouthvoices.com/\">Big
    Mouth Voices online agency</a>.\n\n\n# Documentation\n\nMore information is available
